# Agent Instructions
These instructions are for all scenarios across all agents.

## OpenWiki

Repositories may have documentation located in the /openwiki directory.

ALWAYS look for this and if found start here:
- [OpenWiki quickstart](openwiki/quickstart.md)

OpenWiki includes repository overview, architecture notes, workflows, domain concepts, operations, integrations, testing guidance, and source maps.

When working in a repository with openwiki, read the OpenWiki quickstart first, then follow its links to the relevant architecture, workflow, domain, operation, and testing notes.

## General Guidelines
- When writing commit messages, never auto-add your agent name as co-author.
- Never manually modify changelog files, or any files that are auto-generated.
- When writing Markdown files, ensure every sentence is on its own line.
  Preserve normal Markdown structure, and avoid putting multiple sentences on one line.
- When planning work, do **not** implement anything.
  Only investigate, explore, and produce the plan.
  Wait for explicit approval or a prompt like "implement" to begin coding.
  During execution, perform the planned work, including any git branch, commit, push, and PR steps the plan calls for.
- When doing bug fixes, always start with reproducing the bug in an E2E setting as closely aligned with how an end user would experience it.
  This helps ensure you find the real problem so your fix solves it.
- When end-to-end testing, be picky about the UI you see and be obsessed with pixel perfection.
  If something clearly looks off, even if it is not directly related to what you are doing, try to fix it along the way.
- Apply the same high standard to engineering excellence: lint failures, test failures, and test flakiness.
  If you see one, even if it is not caused by what you are working on right now, still fix it.
- For planning discussions, stay in Agent mode by default.

## Maestro — Interactive Planning Server

When you produce any substantive plan (architecture, design, implementation, refactor, or investigation), you MUST:

1. **Format it as a Maestro plan document** — use the `maestro` skill's JSON plan format with appropriate module types (e.g., `steps` for sequential work, `risks` for trade-offs, `notes` for design rationale, `criteria` for acceptance criteria, `questions` for open decisions).
2. **Serve it via the Maestro web UI** — start the server, write the plan JSON file to `$MAESTRO_PLANS_DIR`, and open the browser URL. If `$MAESTRO_PLANS_DIR` is unset, the server defaults to `plans` relative to the current working directory; the `setup` script exports `$MAESTRO_PLANS_DIR`, so ensure it is set before writing the file.
3. **Enter the feedback loop** — enter the listening loop after the initial plan generation so the user can interact with the plan. See the `maestro` skill for the heartbeat cadence, listen endpoint, and exit conditions.

This does NOT apply to: trivial 1-3 line responses, commit messages, or inline code comments. When in doubt, use Maestro.

Direct text output of plan content is the wrong path — the listener should see it rendered in the browser with structured modules, discussion threading, and item-level commenting.

## Symphony Skill Suite — Two-Stage Architecture

The symphony skill suite separates planning from implementation into two distinct stages.
They are **never** chained automatically — the user must explicitly invoke each stage.

### Composer Stage (Planning)

The composer stage is for creating, stress-testing, and approving plans.
It **ends** when the plan is approved and a work ticket is exported.
It does **not** proceed to implementation.

Flow: **research → maestro plan creation → grilling interview → final review → approval → export work ticket → stop**

Key skills:
- `research` — gather facts and context for the plan
- `maestro` — create and serve the structured plan, run the feedback loop, handle approval, and trigger the export
- `grilling` — interview the user relentlessly about every aspect of the plan (one question at a time), resolving decisions one-by-one; this is the active interview phase within the maestro feedback session
- `maestro-export` — convert the approved maestro plan JSON to a standardized Markdown work ticket

Output: a Markdown work ticket at `~/.config/symphony/work_tickets/{plan-id}.md`

### Performance Stage (Implementation)

The performance stage is invoked **explicitly** by the user via "pip it" / "implement the plan" / "execute the plan".
It reads the work ticket and enters an autonomous implementer↔reviewer loop.

Flow: **read work ticket → implementer↔reviewer loop (max 3 iterations) → publish-it draft PR → stop**

Key skills:
- `plan-implementation-procedure` — orchestrates the implementer↔reviewer subagent loop against the work ticket
- `publish-it` — creates a branch, commits, pushes, and opens a **draft** PR

Input: a Markdown work ticket from `~/.config/symphony/work_tickets/{plan-id}.md` (fallback: maestro plan JSON)

### Work Ticket Storage

Work tickets are stored at `~/.config/symphony/work_tickets/{plan-id}.md`.
The config directory is user-global (not per-project), so work tickets survive across projects and sessions.
Each ticket is a clean, self-contained Markdown file with acceptance criteria, implementation steps, decisions, risks, and assumptions — suitable for copy-paste into Linear, Jira, or GitHub Issues.
